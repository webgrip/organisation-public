# All Decisions

This page provides a comprehensive index of all Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) in the WebGrip organisation.

## ADR Index

### Template & Standards

| ADR | Title | Status | Date | Tags |

| [ADR-0000](../../docs/adrs/0000-template.md) | Template | Template | - | Template, Standards |

### Active Decisions

> **Current Status**: Only the template ADR exists. Future architectural decisions will be documented here as they are made.

### Proposed Decisions

### Superseded Decisions

> **Note**: No ADRs have been superseded yet. Historical decisions will be listed here when they are replaced.

### Rejected Decisions

> **Note**: No ADRs have been rejected yet. Rejected alternatives will be documented here for reference.

**ADR-0002: Traefik vs. Nginx Ingress Controller**
- Evaluation of ingress controller options
- Feature comparison and performance analysis
- Integration with certificate management

**ADR-0003: Helm vs. Kustomize for Configuration Management**
- Infrastructure as Code approach selection
- Template complexity vs. maintainability trade-offs
- Secrets management integration

### Security Decisions

**ADR-0004: Age + SOPS for Secrets Management**
- Comparison with HashiCorp Vault, Sealed Secrets, etc.
- Operational complexity vs. security requirements
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines

**ADR-0005: Certificate Management Strategy**
- Let's Encrypt vs. custom CA vs. external certificate providers
- Automation requirements and certificate lifecycle
- Compliance and security considerations

### Monitoring & Observability

**ADR-0006: Grafana Stack Architecture**
- Monitoring platform selection and configuration
- Prometheus vs. alternative metrics systems
- Dashboard standardization and governance

**ADR-0007: Logging Strategy**
- Centralized logging vs. distributed logging
- Log retention and compliance requirements
- Integration with monitoring and alerting

### CI/CD Decisions

**ADR-0008: GitHub Actions Runner Controller (ARC)**
- Self-hosted vs. GitHub-hosted runners
- Cost optimization and security considerations
- Scaling and performance requirements

**ADR-0009: GitOps vs. Push-based Deployment**
- Deployment strategy and automation approach
- Security and audit trail requirements
- Developer experience and operational complexity

## ADR Review Schedule

### Quarterly Reviews

**Q1 Review (January-March)**:
- Review all "Accepted" ADRs for continued relevance
- Validate ongoing guardrails and monitoring
- Update consequences and lessons learned

**Q2 Review (April-June)**:
- Architecture evolution assessment
- Technology landscape changes
- Cross-ADR dependency analysis

**Q3 Review (July-September)**:
- Performance and scalability validation
- Security and compliance updates
- Operational experience assessment

**Q4 Review (October-December)**:
- Annual architecture health check
- ADR process improvement
- Strategic planning alignment

### Triggers for ADR Updates

**Technology Updates**:
- Major version updates of core platform components
- End-of-life announcements for current technologies
- New technology adoption in the ecosystem

**Performance Issues**:
- SLA/SLO violations related to architectural decisions
- Scalability bottlenecks requiring architectural changes
- Cost optimization opportunities

**Security Changes**:
- New security threats or vulnerabilities
- Compliance requirement changes
- Security incident learnings

**Operational Changes**:
- Team structure or ownership changes
- Process improvements or automation
- Tool consolidation or standardization

## ADR Metrics & Analytics

### Decision Quality Metrics

**Decision Success Rate**:
- Percentage of ADRs still valid after 1 year
- Number of superseded vs. deprecated decisions
- Implementation success rate

**Decision Impact**:
- Performance improvements from architectural decisions
- Cost savings or increases from technology choices
- Developer productivity impact

**Decision Speed**:
- Time from problem identification to ADR approval
- Review cycle time for proposed ADRs
- Implementation time from ADR approval

### Process Metrics

**ADR Coverage**:
- Percentage of major architectural decisions documented
- Cross-reference coverage between code and ADRs
- Stakeholder participation in ADR reviews

**ADR Quality**:
- Completeness of ADR sections
- Validation method effectiveness
- Long-term accuracy of predictions

## Contributing to ADRs

### Creating New ADRs

1. **Copy Template**: Start with [ADR template](../../docs/adrs/0000-template.md)
2. **Assign Number**: Use next sequential number (ADR-NNNN)
3. **Complete Sections**: Fill all required sections thoroughly
4. **Gather Input**: Collect stakeholder feedback and review
5. **Submit PR**: Create pull request with ADR for review
6. **Update Index**: Add to this index upon approval

### ADR Review Process

**Technical Review**:
- Architecture team review for technical accuracy
- Cross-team impact assessment
- Performance and scalability validation

**Business Review**:
- Stakeholder alignment and business impact
- Resource and timeline implications
- Risk assessment and mitigation

**Final Approval**:
- Decision approval by designated authority
- Status update to "Accepted"
- Publication and communication

### Maintaining Existing ADRs

**Regular Updates**:
- Quarterly review of validation methods
- Update consequences based on real-world experience
- Revision log updates for significant changes

**Status Changes**:
- Deprecation when decisions become obsolete
- Supersession when new decisions replace old ones
- Amendment for minor corrections or clarifications

## Search and Discovery

### Finding Relevant ADRs

**By Technology**:
