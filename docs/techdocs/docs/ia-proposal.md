# Information Architecture Proposal

Based on analysis of the WebGrip Organisation Public Repository, I propose three alternative information architectures for our TechDocs site. This repository serves as the foundational infrastructure platform for the organization, focusing on Kubernetes operations, Backstage catalog management, and CI/CD automation.

## Repository Analysis Summary

**Repository Type**: Infrastructure Operations + Platform Engineering + Organization Catalog
**Primary Users**: Platform engineers, SREs, infrastructure teams, developers deploying to the platform
**Core Technologies**: Kubernetes, Helm, Backstage, GitHub Actions, SOPS/Age, Grafana, Traefik

**Key Repository Seams Identified**:
- **Organization**: Backstage domains, systems, components, groups (catalog/)
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes cluster components via Helm charts (ops/helm/)
- **Operations**: CI/CD workflows, secret management, monitoring (workflows, ops/secrets)
- **Platform Services**: Ingress, certificates, runners, observability
- **Governance**: ADRs, security, compliance

## Alternative 1: Organization-First Architecture

**Rationale**: Start with Backstage organizational structure, then drill into technical implementation. This approach mirrors how teams think about ownership and responsibilities.

**Navigation Structure**:
```
├── Overview
├── Organization
│   ├── Domains & Systems
│   ├── Components & Services  
│   ├── Teams & Ownership
│   └── Resource Catalog
├── Platform Infrastructure

│   ├── Networking & Ingress
│   └── Monitoring Stack
├── Operations & Workflows
│   ├── CI/CD Pipelines
│   ├── Secret Management
│   ├── Application Lifecycle
│   └── Platform Maintenance
├── Developer Experience
│   ├── Getting Started
│   ├── Deployment Patterns
│   ├── Troubleshooting
│   └── Contributing
└── Governance
    ├── Architecture Decisions (ADRs)
    ├── Security & Compliance
    └── Standards & Conventions
```

**Feeds from Repository**:
- Organization → `catalog/` (domains, systems, components, groups)
- Platform Infrastructure → `ops/helm/` (all charts), `grafana-dashboards/`
- Operations → `.github/workflows/`, `ops/secrets/`, `Makefile`
- Developer Experience → `README.md`, workflow templates
- Governance → `docs/adrs/`, security annotations

**Strengths**: Clear ownership boundaries, mirrors Backstage structure, good for organizational alignment
**Weaknesses**: Technical details scattered across organizational boundaries

## Alternative 2: Infrastructure-First Architecture  

**Rationale**: Start with Kubernetes cluster architecture and technical systems, then layer organizational context. Best for platform engineers who think in technical layers.

**Navigation Structure**:
```
├── Overview
├── Cluster Architecture
│   ├── Infrastructure Overview
│   ├── Network Architecture
│   ├── Security Model
│   └── Resource Management
├── Platform Components
│   ├── Ingress & Load Balancing
│   ├── Certificate Management
│   ├── Monitoring & Observability
│   ├── CI/CD Infrastructure
│   └── Secret Management
├── Service Catalog
│   ├── Backstage Integration
│   ├── Domains & Systems
│   ├── Component Registry
│   └── API Contracts
├── Operations Runbooks

│   ├── Monitoring & Alerting
│   ├── Incident Response
│   ├── Backup & Recovery
│   └── Maintenance Tasks
├── Developer Workflows

│   ├── CI/CD Patterns
│   └── Local Development
└── Governance & Standards
    ├── Architecture Decisions (ADRs)
    ├── Security Policies
    └── Operational Standards
```

**Feeds from Repository**:
- Cluster Architecture → `ops/helm/` (infrastructure charts), `catalog/systems/`
- Platform Components → `ops/helm/` (by component type), `grafana-dashboards/`
- Service Catalog → `catalog/` (all entities)
- Operations → `Makefile`, `.github/workflows/`, `ops/secrets/`
- Developer Workflows → workflow templates, `README.md`
- Governance → `docs/adrs/`, security configs

**Strengths**: Technical clarity, matches operational mindset, clear service boundaries
**Weaknesses**: Organizational context less prominent, steeper learning curve for non-platform engineers

## Alternative 3: Workflow-First Architecture

**Rationale**: Organize around common user workflows and tasks. Task-oriented approach that matches how people actually use the platform.

**Navigation Structure**:
```
├── Overview
├── Getting Started
│   ├── Platform Overview
│   ├── Access & Prerequisites
│   ├── First Deployment
│   └── Key Concepts
├── Application Lifecycle
│   ├── Creating New Applications
│   ├── Deployment Patterns
│   ├── Configuration Management
│   ├── Monitoring & Observability
│   └── Troubleshooting
├── Platform Management
│   ├── Infrastructure Components
│   ├── Service Maintenance
│   ├── Scaling & Capacity
│   ├── Security Operations
│   └── Disaster Recovery
├── Organization & Catalog
│   ├── Service Discovery
│   ├── Team Structure
│   ├── Component Ownership
│   └── API Documentation
├── Advanced Topics
│   ├── Custom Components
│   ├── CI/CD Customization
│   ├── Integration Patterns
│   └── Performance Optimization
└── Reference
    ├── Architecture Decisions (ADRs)
    ├── API References
    ├── Configuration Schemas
    └── Troubleshooting Index
```

**Feeds from Repository**:
- Getting Started → `README.md`, requirements, basic workflows
- Application Lifecycle → `.github/workflows/`, templates, `ops/helm/950-example-services/`
- Platform Management → `ops/helm/` (core infrastructure), `Makefile`, monitoring
- Organization & Catalog → `catalog/` (all entities)
- Advanced Topics → Complex helm charts, custom workflows
- Reference → `docs/adrs/`, schemas, troubleshooting guides

**Strengths**: User-centric, task-oriented, excellent for onboarding, practical focus
**Weaknesses**: Potential duplication across workflows, harder to maintain technical coherence

## Recommendation: Infrastructure-First Architecture

**Selected**: **Alternative 2: Infrastructure-First Architecture**

**Justification for this Repository**:

1. **Primary Audience**: Platform engineers and SREs who think in technical layers and system boundaries
2. **Repository Purpose**: This is an infrastructure operations repository, not an application development repository
3. **Technical Coherence**: The Helm chart organization (by functional area) maps well to the infrastructure-first approach
4. **Operational Clarity**: Platform components are the primary abstraction layer that users interact with
5. **Scalability**: As the platform grows, new infrastructure components can be easily slotted into existing categories
6. **Troubleshooting**: When things break, operators think in terms of "which component failed" rather than "which workflow failed"

**Key Benefits for WebGrip**:
- **Clear Technical Boundaries**: Each major platform component gets dedicated documentation space
- **Operational Focus**: Aligns with how platform teams operate and maintain systems  
- **Backstage Integration**: Service catalog section provides organizational context without losing technical focus
- **Ownership Model**: Technical component ownership maps to team responsibilities
- **Growth Pattern**: New platform capabilities can be easily added to existing technical categories

**Tradeoffs Accepted**:
- **Steeper Learning Curve**: New developers may need more guidance to find workflow-specific information
- **Organizational Context**: Team/domain information is less prominent but still accessible via Service Catalog section

**Validation Approach**:
The infrastructure-first approach aligns with the repository's Helm chart organization pattern and the technical focus of the existing Backstage catalog entities. This IA will provide clear technical documentation while maintaining links to organizational structure through the Service Catalog section.

## Next Steps

1. Generate `mkdocs.yml` navigation based on the Infrastructure-First architecture
2. Map specific repository locations to each documentation section
3. Begin content creation starting with Cluster Architecture and Platform Components
4. Ensure cross-references between technical components and organizational entities (Backstage catalog)
