# Architecture Decisions (ADRs)

This page provides access to all **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** for the WebGrip platform, documenting significant architectural choices, their rationale, and evolution over time.

## What are ADRs?

**Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** document important architectural decisions made during the development and evolution of the platform. They capture:

- **Context**: The situation that led to the decision
- **Decision**: What was decided and why
- **Consequences**: The positive and negative impacts of the decision
- **Status**: Whether the decision is proposed, accepted, rejected, or superseded

## ADR Repository

**Location**: [`docs/adrs/`](../../../../docs/adrs/)
**Format**: [MADR (Markdown Architecture Decision Records)](https://adr.github.io/madr/)
**Template**: [`docs/adrs/0000-template.md`](../../../../docs/adrs/0000-template.md)

### ADR Template Structure

Our ADRs follow the **MADR v3+** format with WebGrip-specific enhancements:

```markdown

## Creating ADRs

### When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when making decisions that:

- **Affect Multiple Teams**: Cross-cutting concerns that impact multiple components
- **Have Long-term Impact**: Decisions that are difficult or expensive to reverse
- **Involve Trade-offs**: Choices between competing technical approaches
- **Establish Patterns**: Decisions that set precedents for future development
- **Impact Security/Compliance**: Changes affecting security posture or compliance
- **Require Stakeholder Buy-in**: Decisions needing broader organizational approval

### ADR Creation Process

    DRAFT --> RESEARCH[Research Options]
    RESEARCH --> STAKEHOLDER[Stakeholder Review]
    STAKEHOLDER --> FEEDBACK[Incorporate Feedback]
    FEEDBACK --> APPROVE[Decision Approval]
    APPROVE --> IMPLEMENT[Implementation]

    MONITOR --> REVIEW[Periodic Review]
    REVIEW --> UPDATE[Update ADR if needed]

```

### Step-by-Step ADR Creation

1. **Copy Template**:
   ```bash
   # Copy the template to create a new ADR
   cp docs/adrs/0000-template.md docs/adrs/NNNN-descriptive-title.md
   ```

2. **Number Assignment**:
   - Use sequential numbering (0001, 0002, etc.)
   - Check existing ADRs to determine next number
   - Reserve numbers for in-progress ADRs

3. **Fill Out Sections**:
   - **Context**: Describe the problem and constraints
   - **Options**: Research and document 3-5 viable alternatives
   - **Decision**: Clearly state what was decided
   - **Rationale**: Explain why this option was chosen
   - **Consequences**: Document both positive and negative impacts

4. **Stakeholder Review**:
   - Share with relevant technical leads
   - Include security and compliance review if applicable
   - Incorporate feedback and update draft

5. **Approval Process**:
   - Technical approval from domain experts
   - Management approval for significant decisions
   - Security sign-off for security-impacting decisions

6. **Implementation Tracking**:
   - Link to implementation tasks or tickets
   - Define success metrics and monitoring
   - Schedule follow-up reviews

### ADR Review Guidelines

**Review Criteria**:
- [ ] Problem statement is clear and specific
- [ ] Multiple options were considered
- [ ] Decision rationale is well-documented
- [ ] Consequences (both positive and negative) are identified
- [ ] Validation approach is defined
- [ ] Security and compliance impact assessed
- [ ] Implementation plan is clear

**Review Participants**:
- **Technical Lead**: Domain expertise and technical feasibility
- **Security Engineer**: Security implications and compliance
- **Platform Engineer**: Infrastructure and operational impact
- **Product Owner**: Business alignment and priority

### Maintenance Procedures

**Quarterly ADR Review**:
- Review all "Accepted" ADRs for continued relevance
- Update status to "Deprecated" for outdated decisions
- Create new ADRs for evolved approaches
- Update implementation links and validation results

**ADR Updates**:
- Minor updates: Update version number and revision log
- Major changes: Consider creating a new ADR that supersedes the original
- Status changes: Update status and add superseding ADR references

### ADR Archive Management

**File Organization**:
```
docs/adrs/
├── 0000-template.md              # Template for new ADRs
├── 0001-kubernetes-platform.md   # Platform choice
├── 0002-secret-management.md     # Secret management approach
├── 0003-monitoring-stack.md      # Observability decisions
├── 0004-ingress-controller.md    # Ingress solution choice
└── superseded/                   # Archived superseded ADRs
    └── 0002-old-secret-mgmt.md
```

**Archival Process**:
- Move superseded ADRs to `superseded/` directory
- Update references in superseding ADRs
- Maintain redirect or reference in main ADR list

## Integration with Development Process

### ADR Requirements in Development

**For Infrastructure Changes**:
- New platform component adoptions require ADR
- Major configuration changes need ADR review
- Security model changes must have ADR approval

**For Application Patterns**:
- New application architecture patterns
- Development toolchain changes
- CI/CD workflow modifications

### ADR Review in Pull Requests

**Pull Request Template** should include:
```markdown
## Architecture Decision Record
- [ ] This change requires an ADR (significant architectural decision)
- [ ] ADR has been created and approved: [Link to ADR]
- [ ] This change implements an existing ADR: [Link to ADR]
- [ ] No ADR required (minor change with no architectural impact)
```

### ADR Impact Assessment

**Before Implementation**:
- Review existing ADRs for conflicts or dependencies
- Assess whether new ADR supersedes existing decisions
- Identify stakeholders who need to be informed

**During Implementation**:
- Reference ADR in code comments for context
- Include ADR links in configuration documentation
- Update ADR with implementation lessons learned

**After Implementation**:
- Validate ADR predictions against actual outcomes
- Update ADR with real-world results and metrics
- Schedule periodic review based on validation plan

## Tooling and Automation

### ADR Generation Tools

**ADR CLI Tools** (Optional enhancements):
```bash
# Install ADR tools (if team decides to adopt)
npm install -g adr-log adr-viewer

# Generate ADR index
adr-log -d docs/adrs/ > adr-index.md

# Create interactive ADR browser
adr-viewer -d docs/adrs/ -o adr-browser/
```

### Integration with Documentation

**TechDocs Integration**: This page automatically links to ADRs in the repository:
- **Direct Links**: Links point to ADR files in the repository
- **Status Tracking**: ADR status is maintained in the individual files
- **Search Integration**: ADRs are searchable through TechDocs search

**Backstage Integration**: ADRs can be linked from component entities:
```yaml
# In component definitions
annotations:
  backstage.io/adr-location: docs/adrs
```
