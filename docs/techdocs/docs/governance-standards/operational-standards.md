# Operational Standards

This page documents the operational standards, maintenance procedures, and governance processes for the WebGrip platform and its documentation.

## Documentation Maintenance

### TechDocs Maintenance

**Responsibility**: Infrastructure Team
**Review Schedule**: Quarterly or after major platform changes
**Update Triggers**: Infrastructure changes, new component deployments, architectural decisions

#### Maintenance Process

**1. Content Review**:
```bash
# Review all documentation links
find docs/techdocs/docs -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "https\|http\|\./" {} \;

# Check for broken internal links
# Use markdown link checker or manual verification

# Validate external references
# Ensure all repository links point to existing files
```

**2. Information Architecture Updates**:
- Review IA for new platform components
- Add new sections for major architectural changes
- Update navigation in `mkdocs.yml` for new content
- Ensure cross-references remain accurate

**3. Content Accuracy Validation**:
- Verify configuration examples against actual repository files
- Update version numbers and tool versions
- Validate command examples and procedures
- Test deployment procedures in staging environment

**4. Repository Alignment**:
- Ensure documentation structure mirrors repository organization
- Update file paths when repository structure changes
- Maintain assumption blocks for inferred behavior
- Add new ADRs for significant architectural decisions

#### TechDocs Publishing Process

**Automated Publishing**: [`.github/workflows/on_docs_change.yml`](../../../../.github/workflows/on_docs_change.yml)

```yaml
# Automatic publishing workflow
name: '[Workflow] On Documentation Change'
on:
  push:
    branches: ['main']
    paths: ['docs/techdocs/**']
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  generate-documentation:
    name: 'Generate'
    uses: webgrip/workflows/.github/workflows/techdocs-generate.yml@main
    with:
      source-dir: 'docs/techdocs'

  deploy-documentation:
    name: 'Deploy'
    uses: webgrip/workflows/.github/workflows/techdocs-deploy-gh-pages.yml@main
    needs: generate-documentation
```

**Manual Publishing** (if needed):
```bash
# Local TechDocs generation and testing
cd docs/techdocs
mkdocs serve

# Build for production
mkdocs build

# Verify build output
ls -la site/
```

#### Content Update Guidelines

**Adding New Platform Components**:
1. **Create Component Page**: Add page in `platform-components/` directory
2. **Update Navigation**: Add entry to `mkdocs.yml` navigation
3. **Cross-Reference**: Link from related pages (architecture, runbooks)
4. **Backstage Integration**: Update component catalog entries
5. **Review Process**: Technical review before publishing

**Updating Existing Content**:
1. **Identify Impact**: Assess which pages need updates
2. **Maintain Links**: Ensure all links remain valid
3. **Update Assumptions**: Review and update assumption blocks
4. **Version Tracking**: Note significant changes in commit messages

### Backstage Maintenance

**Entity Definition Updates**:
- **Quarterly Review**: Verify all entity definitions are accurate
- **Ownership Updates**: Update component ownership when teams change
- **Lifecycle Management**: Promote experimental → production, mark deprecated
- **Relationship Mapping**: Ensure component dependencies are current

**Catalog Hygiene**:
```bash
# Validate catalog entities
cd catalog/
find . -name "*.yaml" -exec yamllint {} \;

# Check for orphaned entities
# Verify all referenced entities exist

# Update entity metadata
# Ensure annotations and links are current
```

stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Experimental
    Experimental --> Production
    Production --> Deprecated
    Deprecated --> [*]
    
    note right of Experimental
        New components
        Active development
        Breaking changes allowed
    end note
    
    note right of Production
        Stable components
        SLA commitments
        Backward compatibility
    end note
    
    note right of Deprecated
